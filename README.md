Code for the paper "Principled feature attribution for unsupervised gene expression analysis" (PAUSE). 
For more information, see our preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.03.490535v1.

For code to generate the models used, see models.py. Pathway attributions and gene attributions are generated using code from pathexplainer.py. Benchmarking pathways attributions against other methods for ranking pathway importance is done using the files benchmark_pmvae.py, benchmark_intercode.py, and top_pathways.py. For code to generate the figures in the paper, see "figures".
